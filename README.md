# recipe_app

A new Flutter application.

Problem Statement:
-----------------
- Use Firebase and Redux.
- 1-2 simple UI Widgets that display data loaded using Redux init method and a call to Firebase from the redux middleware.
- Use a button/form make an update using redux action, validating the input and then calling Firebase to update and also updating the redux datastore.
- Data should come from Firebase, Domain model should use this data and some other data not from Firebase (anything about the device is good).
- View model should be based on the Domain model but not have any logic.
- Widget tests or unit tests.
